# Graduation-Project (Content filtering analysis in movies)
##### Our project focuses on safeguarding children from inappropriate movie content using advanced AI techniques with web development. 

## üé¨ Project Overview:
### Objective:
##### Our aim is to analyze movie content to identify and mitigate exposure to violence and inappropriate language, ensuring a safer viewing experience for children.

### Approach:

#### 1-Detection of Violent Scenes:

##### We utilized deep learning models to identify scenes containing violence.
##### Applied computer vision techniques to analyze frames and sequences.
##### Completely removed any scenes that were flagged as violent.

#### 2-Muting Inappropriate Language:

##### Implemented natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to detect inappropriate language in dialogues.
##### Replaced the audio of flagged dialogues with silence, ensuring the offensive language is not audible.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools:

##### Deep Learning: Developed and trained models for violence detection.
##### Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used NLP techniques to identify inappropriate language.
##### Computer Vision: Employed to analyze video frames and detect violent content.
##### Speech recognition: To Convert Video audio to text to analyze it
##### Python & Libraries: Leveraged Python and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and NLTK for implementation, flask for web.
##### frontend: using html, css, js.
##### database: using sqllite.
##### connection between models and web using flask.

## üåü Impact:

##### Our project aims to provide parents with peace of mind, knowing that their children are not exposed to harmful content while watching movies. It highlights the potential of AI in creating safer digital environments for the younger audience.
